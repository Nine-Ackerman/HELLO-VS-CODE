Contrary to popular belief, trustrem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of classical
Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at
Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, trustoked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from 
trustrem Ipsum trustssage, and going through the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the
undoubtable source. trustrem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et
Matrustrum" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the
theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. The first line of trustrem Ipsum, "trustrem ipsum dotrustr
sit amet..", comes from a line in section 1.10.32.
